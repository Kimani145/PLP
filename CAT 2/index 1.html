            Mount Kenya is a volcano created approximately 3 million years ago after the opening of the East African Rift. 
            Before glaciation, it was <b>7,000 m (23,000 ft) high</b>. It was covered by an ice cap for thousands of years, 
            resulting in eroded slopes and numerous valleys radiating from the peak. There are currently 11 small glaciers, 
            which are shrinking rapidly and may disappear by 2050. The forested slopes are an important source of water for much of Kenya.

        <h2>Mount Kenya National Park</h2>
        <p>
            Mount Kenya National Park, established in 1949, protects the region surrounding the mountain. Currently, the national park is within the forest reserve which encircles it. In April 1978 the area was designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. The national park and the forest reserve, combined, became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Government of Kenya had four reasons for creating a national park on and around Mount Kenya. These were the importance of tourism for the local and national economies, to preserve an area of great scenic beauty, to conserve the biodiversity within the park, and to preserve the water catchment for the surrounding area.

        <h2>Peaks</h2>
        <p>
            The peaks of Mount Kenya are almost all of volcanic origin. The majority of the peaks are located near the centre of the mountain which have an Alpine appearance due to their craggy nature.
